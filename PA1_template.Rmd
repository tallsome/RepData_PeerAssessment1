## Loading and preprocessing the data

df<-read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE)

#Removes missing value from original dataframe
df1<-filter(df, !is.na(steps))


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?

#Sorting and adding total steps taken each day. 
stepperday<-group_by(df1,date)
totalstep<-summarise(stepperday, totalstepperday=sum(steps))

with(totalstep, hist(totalstepperday,xlab="Total Steps Per Day", main="Histogram of Total Steps Taken Each Day", col="blue"))

mean(totalstep$totalstepperday)
median(totalstep$totalstepperday)

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

dailyactivity<-aggregate(steps~interval, data=df, mean, na.rm=T)
names(dailyactivity)<-c("interval", "avg_step")

with(dailyactivity, plot(x=interval, y=avg_step, type="l", col="blue", ylab="Avg Steps Taken, Averaged Across all Days", main="Daily Activity Pattern"))

dailyactivity[which.max(dailyactivity$avg_step), ]$interval

## Imputing missing values

#counting the total number of missing step values.
sum(is.na(df))

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
